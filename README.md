# WVIC: association and interaction test for genetic markers and interval-censored survival outcomes

This tutorial demonstrates the implmentation of proposed interaction and association test for interval-censored survival outcomes, whose underlying model is semiparametric transformation model. The main function is _WVIC_comprisk_main.R_, which involves basic functions in _Base_Function_Transform_frailty.R_ and method for obtaining Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE) for regression coefficients and cumulative baseline function in _unpencoxIC.default.R_ (Li et. al. (2019) https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280219856238) or R functions start with _semiparam_transform_model_.

# Weighted V test (WVIC) usage
To perform the test, use function _WVIC_comprisk_main.R_ in 'R_code' file.
